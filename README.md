## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Important Info:
>The built-in Cam only works on the application's native code editor - to record a screen or window other than the one in the application, use the "My Simple Cam* " widget designed for this purpose.

*** *This widget installs directly on MacOs/Linux/Windows computers, there is no web version, it is a desktop version only.***

**:x:** this application is  not responsive on mobile :mobile_phone_off: (as it is an application for people working in front of a computer - developer like me for example - I did not find useful to do media queries for that).
